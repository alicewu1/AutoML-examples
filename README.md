# AutoML-examples
**HHA 507 / Data Science / Assignment 9 / Auto ML**


# This repo aims to:
- using dataset from:    , conduct 2 experiments using the autoML package ***mljar-supervised***
- Experiment 1: focused around classification (binary or multi-class outcome variable)
- Experiment 2: focused around regression (continuous outcome variable)


- Select a dataset of your own choosing (or select my modified version of SPARCS - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hantswilliams/HHA-507-2022/main/autoML/datasets/data_sparcs.csv) 



# Experiment 1: Classification
- include outputs in the folder
    - Describe the two dependent variables (outcomes) for experiment 1 and experiment 2 
    - Describe for each experiment: 
        - What was the best performing model (please interpret (a) log-loss or RMSE between models, and (b) AUC) 
        - How much better (? if any) did the model perform compared to baseline

# Experiment 2
- include outputs in the folder
    - Describe the two dependent variables (outcomes) for experiment 1 and experiment 2 
    - Describe for each experiment: 
        - What was the best performing model (please interpret (a) log-loss or RMSE between models, and (b) AUC) 
        - How much better (? if any) did the model perform compared to baseline
